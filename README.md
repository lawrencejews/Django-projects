## Django Projects
Django provides the various commands that are used to perform migration related tasks. 
- `makemigrations` : It is used to create a migration file that contains code for the tabled schema of a model.
- `migrate` : It creates table according to the schema defined in the migration file.
- `sqlmigrate` : It is used to show a raw SQL query of the applied migration.
- `showmigrations` : It lists out all the migrations and their status.
